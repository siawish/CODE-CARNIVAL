### üìÇ Database Overview
The database is the core of Code Carnival, tracking user data, game progress, scores, levels, and rewards. It includes:

1. **Users Table**:
   - Stores user credentials with secure password hashing.
   - Tracks account creation timestamps.

2. **Games Table**:
   - Maintains game details like name, description, maximum levels, and the MVP (Most Valuable Player).

3. **Levels Table**:
   - Manages individual levels of each game, including descriptions.

4. **Scores Table**:
   - Tracks scores, time spent, and achievement timestamps for each user in every game.

5. **UserGameProgress Table**:
   - Monitors user progress by recording the current level and last played time.

6. **Rewards Table**:
   - Records rewards earned by users in specific games.

7. **GameLogs Table**:
   - Logs gameplay data in JSON or serialized formats for detailed activity tracking.
